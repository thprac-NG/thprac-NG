## [README](https://github.com/touhouworldcup/thprac/blob/master/README.md)

## A very ambitious to-do list:

- [ ] Automatically formatting code using GitHub Action (as suggested by issue [#141](https://github.com/touhouworldcup/thprac/issues/141)); (Easy)
- [ ] Sacrificing some compile speed to move most of the magic numbers out of the .cpp files (by using some dark magic, maybe the run-time efficiency can be unaffected); (Normal)
- [ ] Adding logs and comments; (Hard)
- [ ] Eventually rewriting the whole repository, bumping the version number to 3. (Lunatic)

## Some extra to-dos:

- [ ] Providing some easy-to-use APIs for everyone to customize their specialized training. (Please refer to [RUEEE's fork](https://github.com/RUEEE/thprac))

I doubt we can finish the above before Comiket 110. (^^;;
